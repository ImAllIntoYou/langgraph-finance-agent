# LangGraph AI Agent 


## An example product AI Agent utilizing LangGraph 

In this project, the final product is a finance agent analyzing basic reporting data (ex. financials) that displays on Streamlit (in file finance_agent.py). This and the remaining files showcase key concepts that are required to build the product:
- Calling the chatbot's API in terminal
- Passing guideline prompt and work functions that the agent might need.
- Implement a LangGraph state graph that outlines the agent's workflow. 
- Maintain memory throughout the workflow/session to improve accuracy.
- Add human feedback between the steps (or however you want) to guide the agent.
- Display step by step output from agent with Streamlit.


## Tips from me

This project is largely based on the course "Building Automonous AI Agents with LangGraph (Packt Publishing)" by Instructor Paulo Dichone, i just used Gemini's free services instead of OpenAI's. The course is basically a guide to all the content inside this project.
- Use a virtual environment for this project.
- Make an .env file containing API keys.
- Install the required packages.
- There are a couple of bug updates that I had to do (mainly Sqlite) so it's a little different from original source code. 

If you are able to understand LangGraph and utilize to your own cases, that would serves as the greater purpose of this project.
